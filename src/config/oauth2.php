		 * - GET_authorize
		 * - POST_token
		 * This configuration setting allows you to define what the server will respond if the scopes do not match.
		 * 
		 * This config setting takes a value from a set of three:
		 * - "replicate" will casually ignore the scope given on POST_token and simply copy the scope from the auth token to the access token on an authorization_code request
		 * and on a refresh_code request. Effectively, the scope parameter is now optional on token request
		 * - "dynamic" will parse the scope and allocate scopes to the new token based on a subset of the first one. This can allow you to restrict the scope betzeen requests, but NEVER to extend it.
		 * - "strict" will throw an error if the two scopes do not have exactly the same components (order is irrelevant)
		 * Defaults to "replicate" if unspecified or invalid.
